방법
1. Encapsulate. Leverage and extend the application features by encapsulating its data and functions, making them available as services via an API.
2. Rehost. Redeploy the application component to other infrastructure (physical, virtual or cloud) without modifying its code, features or functions.
3. Replatform. Migrate to a new runtime platform, making minimal changes to the code, but not the code structure, features or functions.
4. Refactor. Restructure and optimize the existing code (although not its external behavior) to remove technical debt and improve nonfunctional attributes.
5. Rearchitect. Materially alter the code to shift it to a new application architecture and exploit new and better capabilities. 
6. Rebuild. Redesign or rewrite the application component from scratch while preserving its scope and specifications.
7. Replace. Eliminate the former application component altogether and replace it, considering new requirements and needs at the same time.
